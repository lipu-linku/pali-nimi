## What does a definition look like?

Separate multiple translations of the same sense of the word with commas. Descriptions of a word's function, if used instead of a translation, should be in \[brackets\]. If one translation is used as an umbrella term for multiple other translations, the umbrella translation should be followed by ", such as:". Separate multiple senses of the word with semicolons. Senses of a word can be either content words, particles, prepositions, preverbs, or numbers. Each sense of a word should be preceded by its type in \(parentheses\) unless it's a content word, in which case it is unmarked, or unless it's the same type as the previous sense listed.

Examples:
```
luka: hand, arm; (number) five
o: (particle) [goes after person/being being addressed]; [goes before optative verb]
pona: positive quality, such as: good, helpful, beneficial, pleasant
tawa: moving; (preposition) to, toward; from the perspective of, according to; for, for the purpose of
```
